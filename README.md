# NepalTransmissionLines
converting UTM coordinates to decimal degrees and stitching these coordinates together to determine Nepal transmission lines

# Python 3
uses packages numpy, pandas, and utm (Bidirectional UTM-WGS84 converter! Thank you, creators!)

# Updates
conversion is in place!
First time around, the utm coordinates were extracted from scanned pdf using online web resources. I am hoping to automate this, alongside the geovisual stitching.
